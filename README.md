A single window multi document sample applicaion with tab bar for OSX

This application contains a coded example of how to make a single-window multi-document application in OSX.

Almost all of this code comes from a blog post written by SASMITO ADIBOWO at http://cutecoder.org/programming/window-multiple-documents/

The tab bar used to control switching between documents is the PSMTabBarControl available from https://github.com/dorianj/PSMTabBarControl

The application is not yet fully complete, but is intended to give developers a jumping off point in their own applicaiton development endeavours.
